## Project Overview
Our project is a **decentralized subscription management** platform designed to revolutionize how users pay for **OTT** (Over-The-Top) services. Built on blockchain technology, we enable seamless cryptocurrency payments for subscriptions and memberships, offering a secure, transparent, and efficient alternative to traditional payment systems.

## How It Works
Intermediary Role: We act as a bridge between users and OTT platforms, facilitating subscription payments using stablecoins to ensure stability and predictability.
Crypto Payments: Users can pay for their favorite OTT services directly from their cryptocurrency wallets, leveraging the speed and global reach of blockchain.
Decentralized Infrastructure: Powered by SidraChain, our platform ensures all transactions are processed securely and transparently, adhering to principles of decentralization and ethical finance.
User Experience: With a focus on simplicity, we integrate with popular wallets, allowing users to subscribe in just a few clicks.
## What Weâ€™re Developing
**Smart Contracts**: Automating subscription payments and transaction splits on the blockchain for reliability and trust.
**API Integration**: Creating robust APIs to connect seamlessly with OTT platforms, enabling them to offer crypto payment options without disrupting their existing systems.
**Payment Gateway**: A user-friendly interface for managing subscriptions, designed to make crypto payments accessible to all.
**Scalable Backend**: A high-performance system to handle growing transaction volumes, ensuring efficiency as our user base expands.
## Vision
We aim to empower users and OTT providers by bridging the gap between cryptocurrency and digital subscriptions, fostering a more inclusive and innovative payment ecosystem.
